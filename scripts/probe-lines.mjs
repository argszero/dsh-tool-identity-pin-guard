/**
 * A `peerDependencies` range is a claim about versions nobody ran. This script
 * makes the claim checkable instead of asserted: for each line the range admits,
 * it copies this package into a scratch directory, pins **the whole line**,
 * installs, builds, and runs the suite.
 *
 * The lines come from the manifest, not from a list here — a probe with its own
 * copy of the contract can drift from the thing it is supposed to be checking.
 * Each `||` segment of the range is one line, and its **newest** published build
 * is the representative: the earliest build of a line is an alpha nobody is left
 * on, and probing it says less than probing the build the line converged to.
 *
 * Three rules this probe follows, because violating any of them measures the
 * probe rather than the line:
 *
 * 1. **The whole line is pinned, not the packages this plugin happens to
 *    import.** The set of harness packages a line carries grows between lines,
 *    so it is read from that line's own `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent` manifest rather
 *    than written down here, and it is widened by every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*`
 *    this package declares (either in `peerDependencies` or in
 *    `devDependencies`, which is what the probe tree installs). Pinning a subset
 *    leaves npm free to resolve the rest from another line, and the resulting
 *    tree is not the line.
 * 2. **`--legacy-peer-deps`.** Without it npm derives peers transitively and can
 *    install a second line's copy of a package to satisfy them — again a tree
 *    that is not the line. The installation is `npm ci`-free on purpose: there
 *    is no lockfile to honour, the pins *are* the specification.
 * 3. **Every pinned package's version is read back after install.** A pin that
 *    silently did not apply is the failure mode this whole script exists to
 *    prevent, so it is asserted rather than assumed, and the assertion runs
 *    before the suite so a mixed tree can never be reported as a passing line.
 *
 * ```sh
 * npm run test:probe-lines                 # every line the range admits
 * npm run test:probe-lines -- 0.2.0-rc.2   # one line
 * npm run test:probe-lines -- --keep       # leave the scratch trees in place
 * ```
 *
 * A line that fails here is removed from the range (manifest, README and the
 * `SUPPORTED_LINES` contract in `test/packaging.spec.mjs`) rather than left
 * claimed. This script is development-only and is not published.
 *
 * @module scripts/probe-lines
